# HRPythonproject
About The Project: 

I currently work in Human Resources and I would like with this project to mock a real-life experience on how to use data analytics to find areas of improvement in an organization. This project is utilizing the Human Resources data set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set). This data set includes a companies with a list of employees and additional information such as names, DOBs, age, gender, marital status, date of hire, reasons for termination, department, position title, pay rate, manager name, and performance score.

The goal of the project verify the gender differences from this data set and answer the following questions:
•   How many females and males does this company have?
•   Are we hiring more women each year? 
•   What is the voluntary and involuntary termination for females or males leaving the company?
•   What is the salary average for males and females?
•   What is the average tenure for females or males?
•   What is the average age for females or Males? 

The project repo includes the following files: 

•   Requirements.txt - Include the packages necessary to run the program. 

•   HR Dataset.CSV - Data set utilized for the project.

•   Genderdifferencesproject.ipynb - Project Completed.

Project Requirements: 

Feature 1 Read data - Read data from a csv file. 

Feature 2 - Manipulate and clean your data: Converted Date of Hire to date format to extract the year of hire (this data will be used later in a chart). Calculated tenure from Date of Hire and calculated age from Date of Birth. Note: Project plan included for feature 2 verify if the employee is active or terminated – I noticed that the data set already has employee status. So I decided to change to the feature described above. 

Feature 3 -  Analyze your data: Counted number of males and females per employment status, calculated average of salary, tenure, and age per gender. Utilized groupby function for calculations. 

Feature 4 and 5 Visualize your data and Interpret your data: Created a pie chart to show the percentage of active females versus males. Created a line chart to show the gender hiring trend over the years. Create a bar chart to show the salary average difference between genders. Markdown with analysis of the data is included.
